# Language Archive â€“ Seed Vault 
A secure, ethically designed database platform for preserving and providing tiered access to cultural heritage materials. This archive enables Indigenous communities, researchers, and scholars to interact with sensitive materials under strict, role-based governance and protection against unauthorized use and AI-Scoping.  

# Project Vision
To create a technologically robust and culturally respectful digital archive that prioritizes Indigenous Data Sovereignty. Our goal is to empower communities to control their digital heritage while facilitating secure academic research. It strives to be a platform to preserve and protect traditions. While our work is deeply informed by Indigenous values and practices, the archive is designed for all communities who seek to preserve, protect, and share their traditions, knowledge, and histories with integrity and respect.
