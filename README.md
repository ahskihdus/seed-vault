## Testing Shaina’s Word Tagging Tool(Instruction for code review) (Ticket 5)

You are in **Shaina’s** Branch for Group C’s Seed Vault product.

Please follow these steps:

1. **Open your Terminal and clone this repository:**

git clone https://github.com/ahskihdus/seed-vault.git
cd seed-vault
git checkout Shaina-Test-Branch

Keep this terminal window open — you’ll need it later!

2. **This unit test requires Python 3.**

Check if Python is installed:
- On Mac:
  ```
  python3 --version
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```
  python --version
  ```

If not installed, follow one of these guides:
- [Mac Installation Guide](https://youtu.be/89eHjZN69Fo?si=Fnlo4QVyc4kUmtF0)
- [Windows Installation Guide](https://youtu.be/YKSpANU8jPE?si=PogU7frQWMneWncz)

3. **Run the tests:**

Navigate to the folder containing the files:
cd TestCode

Then run the following:
- On Mac:
  ```
  python3 test_word_tagging.py
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```
  python test_word_tagging.py
  ```

Expected output:
Ran 8 tests in 0.000s
OK

If you see this, all tests passed successfully.

**Files in this branch:**
- `wordTagging.js` — Implements Word Tagging Tool logic  
- `test_word_tagging.py` — Automated unit tests verifying the functionality  

This feature verifies that tagged words can be created, searched, and updated independently of the main system.

Ticket 5: Word Tagging Tool# Language Archive – Seed Vault 
A secure, ethically designed database platform for preserving and providing tiered access to cultural heritage materials. This archive enables Indigenous communities, researchers, and scholars to interact with sensitive materials under strict, role-based governance and protection against unauthorized use and AI-Scoping.  

# Project Vision
To create a technologically robust and culturally respectful digital archive that prioritizes Indigenous Data Sovereignty. Our goal is to empower communities to control their digital heritage while facilitating secure academic research. It strives to be a platform to preserve and protect traditions. While our work is deeply informed by Indigenous values and practices, the archive is designed for all communities who seek to preserve, protect, and share their traditions, knowledge, and histories with integrity and respect. 

# Key Features  
Layered Role-Based access control  
AI protection methods   
SQL – The backbone of our model will be the SQL Database. Using SQL, we can handle community records, cultural protocols, and user permissions in an organized system. It also supports features like search, version control, and secure access, making the archive both easy to use and dependable for long-term preservation. 
Secure File Management -- A secure upload and storage system for sensitive file types (e.g., audio recordings, documents, images) with encrypted storage. 

# Installation Steps 
### Phase I (preinstallation) - Before installing, ensure that the server meets the hardware and software requirements for sustainable storage and access. Confirm that the infrastructure supports: 
-   Data ethics protocols, including privacy safeguards and respect for cultural sensitivities. 
-   Tiered access controls, so that different user groups (e.g., community members, researchers, general public) can be appropriately supported. 
-   Long-term preservation standards, ensuring interoperability with archival formats and metadata schemas used in cultural heritage stewardship. 
### Phase II (Installation)  - Run the installer to: 
-   Copy program files and create directories in a way that protects the integrity of cultural data. 
-   Register the platform with the operating system while applying secure authentication frameworks to respect community access agreements. 
-   Configure environment variables and libraries to support inclusive metadata standards (e.g., multilingual support, Indigenous knowledge labels). 
-   Establish default tiered access settings that recognize the rights and permissions defined by source communities. 
### Phase III (post-installation) – After installation, configure the environment with cultural sensitivity in mind: 
-   Install extensions and packages that support ethical metadata enrichment (e.g., provenance tracking, cultural sensitivity notices). 
-   Test access layers by running sample queries to verify that restricted, community-only, and public access tiers work as intended. 
-   Document the configuration process transparently, so that future stewards and community partners can audit, trust, and sustain the platform.  

# Usage 
Individuals can submit data (digital artifact, pictures, language, scriptures) using the upload feature. Once the data is uploaded it is reviewed to check its authenticity. To access the data, users can navigate through the drop-down menu or the search bar using key words. All the data is organized according to its group so users can navigate easily throughout the site. 

# License  
All data and cultural content stored within the archive remains the intellectual property of the contributing Indigenous communities, governed by their own protocols and the project's Ethical Use Policy. By contributing to this project, you agree to respect these principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. 

# Credits 
The following people are working as developers and maintainers on the current version: 
-   Destiny Ngigi  
-   Kiara Nelson 
-   Thrisha Duggisetty 
-   Sudhiksha Sadige
